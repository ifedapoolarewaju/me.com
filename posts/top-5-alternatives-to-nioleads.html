        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: Are desktop apps safer than browser extensions and cloud-based tools?</strong><br>
        A: Generally, yes. Desktop applications like Bindago run on your computer, so your LinkedIn login credentials are not stored on a third-party server, reducing the risk of data breaches.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Can I get banned for using these tools?</strong><br>
        A: All automation tools carry some risk as they are against LinkedIn's Terms of Service. However, tools that simulate human behavior with smart delays and have built-in safety limits (like Bindago) significantly reduce this risk. Always start with low volumes and use the tools responsibly.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Do I need Sales Navigator to use these tools?</strong><br>
        A: For most of these tools, especially those focused on lead enrichment and export (like NioLeads, Evaboot, and Wiza), a Sales Navigator subscription is highly recommended to get the best results.</p>

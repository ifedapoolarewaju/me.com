        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: Are desktop applications more secure than Chrome extensions?</strong><br>
        A: Generally, yes. Desktop applications like Bindago and LinkedHelper operate in an environment separate from your browser, providing better stability and security. Your LinkedIn login credentials are not stored on a third-party server, which reduces the risk of data breaches.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Can I be banned for using these tools?</strong><br>
        A: All automation tools carry some risk as they are against LinkedIn's Terms of Service. However, tools that simulate human behavior with intelligent delays and have built-in safety limits (like Bindago) significantly reduce this risk. Always begin with low volumes and use the tools responsibly.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Is Sales Navigator required to use these tools?</strong><br>
        A: While not strictly necessary, it is highly recommended. Sales Navigator offers superior search filters and higher commercial use limits, which helps you get the most out of any automation tool.</p>

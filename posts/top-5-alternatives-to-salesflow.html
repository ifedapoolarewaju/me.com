        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: Are desktop applications more secure than cloud-based tools?</strong><br>
        A: In general, yes. Desktop apps like Bindago operate on your computer, meaning your LinkedIn login details are not saved on a third-party server, which lowers the risk of data breaches.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Can I be banned for using these tools?</strong><br>
        A: All automation tools come with some level of risk as they are against LinkedIn's Terms of Service. However, tools that mimic human behavior with intelligent delays and have built-in safety measures (like Bindago) greatly reduce this risk. Always begin with low activity levels and use the tools sensibly.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Is Sales Navigator necessary to use these tools?</strong><br>
        A: While not mandatory, it is strongly advised. Sales Navigator offers superior search filters and increased commercial use limits, which helps you maximize the effectiveness of any automation tool.</p>

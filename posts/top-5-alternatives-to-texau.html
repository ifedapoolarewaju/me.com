        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: Are desktop apps more secure than cloud-based tools?</strong><br>
        A: Yes, generally. Desktop applications like Bindago run on your own machine, meaning your LinkedIn login details are not stored on a third-party server, which reduces the risk of data breaches.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Can using these tools lead to an account ban?</strong><br>
        A: All automation tools carry some level of risk as they are against LinkedIn's Terms of Service. However, tools that mimic human behavior with smart delays and have built-in safety limits, like Bindago, significantly lower this risk. It's always best to start with low activity volumes and use the tools responsibly.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Is Sales Navigator required to use these tools?</strong><br>
        A: While not strictly necessary, it is highly recommended. Sales Navigator offers superior search filters and higher commercial use limits, which helps you get the most out of any automation tool.</p>

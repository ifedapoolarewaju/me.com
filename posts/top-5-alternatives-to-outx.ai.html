        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: Are desktop applications safer than cloud-based tools?</strong><br>
        A: Generally, yes. Desktop apps like Bindago run on your computer, meaning your LinkedIn credentials are not stored on a third-party server, which minimizes the risk of data breaches.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Is there a risk of being banned for using these tools?</strong><br>
        A: All automation tools carry some risk, as they are against LinkedIn's Terms of Service. However, tools that simulate human behavior with smart delays and safety limits (like Bindago) significantly reduce this risk. Always start with low volumes and use the tools responsibly.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Do I need a Sales Navigator subscription to use these tools?</strong><br>
        A: For most of these tools, particularly those focused on lead export and enrichment like OutX.ai, Evaboot, and Wiza, a Sales Navigator subscription is highly recommended to achieve the best results.</p>

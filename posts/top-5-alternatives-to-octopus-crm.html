        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: Is a desktop application more secure than a browser extension?</strong><br>
        A: Generally, yes. Desktop applications like Bindago run in a separate environment from your browser, offering better stability and security. Your LinkedIn login credentials are not stored on a third-party server, reducing the risk of data breaches.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: What is the risk of an account ban when using automation tools?</strong><br>
        A: All automation tools carry some risk as they are against LinkedIn's Terms of Service. However, tools that simulate human behavior with smart delays and have built-in safety limits (like Bindago) significantly reduce this risk. Always start with low volumes and use the tools responsibly.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Is a Sales Navigator subscription necessary for these tools?</strong><br>
        A: It's not strictly required, but highly recommended. Sales Navigator provides much better search filters and higher commercial use limits, which allows you to get the most out of any automation tool.</p>

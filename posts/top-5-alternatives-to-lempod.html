        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Q: Are desktop applications safer than cloud-based tools?</strong><br>
        A: Generally, yes. Desktop apps like Bindago run on your computer, so your LinkedIn login credentials are not stored on a third-party server, which reduces the risk of data breaches.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Can I get banned for using these tools?</strong><br>
        A: All automation tools carry some risk as they are against LinkedIn's Terms of Service. However, tools that mimic human behavior with smart delays and have built-in safety limits (like Bindago) significantly reduce this risk. Always start with low volumes and use the tools responsibly.</p>
        <p><strong>Q: Do I need Sales Navigator to use these tools?</strong><br>
        A: It is not strictly required, but it is highly recommended. Sales Navigator provides much better search filters and higher commercial use limits, which allows you to get the most out of any automation tool.</p>
